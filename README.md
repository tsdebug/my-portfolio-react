## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository hosts my personal professional portfolio, engineered to be fast, responsive, and scalable. 

Unlike traditional static HTML portfolios, this application is built as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using the **React ecosystem**. It features a custom-built blogging system powered by **Fumadocs MDX**, allowing for type-safe, component-rich documentation and articles directly within the app.

## 🛠️ Tech Architecture
I chose a modern stack to ensure performance and maintainability:

- **Core Framework:** `React.js` (v18+) for component-based UI architecture.
- **Build Tool:** `Vite` for lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds.
- **Styling:** `Tailwind CSS` for a utility-first, fully responsive design system without CSS bloat.
- **Routing:** `React Router DOM` for seamless client-side navigation.
- **Content Management:** `Fumadocs MDX` to manage blog posts and documentation as code, enabling rich content rendering.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Dynamic Project Showcase:** reusable card components that display project details, live demos, and source code links.
- **Integrated Tech Blog:** A fully functional blog section using MDX, allowing me to write technical articles using Markdown + React components.
- **Responsive Layout:** Mobile-first design that adapts flawlessly to tablets and desktops.
- **Direct Connect:** Integrated "Copy Email" functionality and social media quick-links for seamless networking.

## 🔮 Roadmap & Future Improvements
I am treating this portfolio as a living product. Upcoming features include:
- [ ] **Dark Mode:** Implementing a system-wide theme toggler using Tailwind's dark mode class strategy.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization:** Implementing lazy loading for image assets to improve Lighthouse scores.
- [ ] **CMS Integration:** Exploring headless CMS options to decouple content from code further.
